  <h2>What The Heck Is It?</h2>
  <p><em>Heaven wrapped between two slices of bread.</em> A samm'ich conjured
    from beyond our reckoning. <strong>Mere mortal words are not powerful enough
    to describe this samm'ich</strong>. It would be foolish to even attempt to.</p>
<hr>
  <h2> Ingredients </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Peanut Butter from the Bubbling Bog of Stickiness</li>
    <li>Extremeberry Jam stolen from the Radical Teens from the
      Cul-de-sac Of DOOM</li>
    <li>Butter forged from the teat of the Ubercow</li>
    <li>Bananas gifted from the treasury of her majesty, Queen Kong</li>
    <li>Bread of some kind. From the grocery store, I guess.
      Sliced is good.</li>
  </ul>
<hr>
  <h2> Directions </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Steel your nerves. You'll need 'em.</li>
    <li>Find your <strong>STRONGEST</strong> blade.</li>
    <li>Throw it away. It's not strong enough.</li>
    <li>Pack for your journey to the Peaks Of Sorrow.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Did you remember your extra underpants?</li>
        <li>Because you always forget them.</li>
        <li>Okay, but know we're <em>not</em> stopping to buy more.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Find the Crying Horned Peak King.</li>
    <li>Cheer him up. He usually likes a good joke - just nothing dirty.</li>
    <li>For cheering him up successfully, he will give you his
      Bejewled Blade of +2 Spreading</li>
    <li>You are finally ready to begin. Give yourself a tiny high five.</li>
    <li>Return from the Peaks Of Sorrow, but take the scenic route.</li>
    <li>Take some nice pictures.</li>
    <li>Post those pictures to social media.</li>
    <li>Gather your ingredients and bind them to the table with leather
      straps</li>
    <li>Say the following incantation:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"ELQG WKHVH LQJUHGLHQWV! KROG WKHP WR WKH WDEOH!
          ELQG WKHVH LQJUHGLHQWV!!!"</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <li>Take two slices of bread and lay them within the boundary of the
      alchemical circle.</li>
    <li>Have Alexa play your samm'ich crafting playlist.</li>
    <li>Grasp the Bejewled Blade of +2 Spreading</li>
    <li>Dip the Bejewled Blade of +2 Spreading in the Peanut Butter</li>
    <li>Ignore its screams of anguish.</li>
    <li>Force the Bejewled Blade of +2 Spreading to one of the slices
      of bread.</li>
    <li>Try not to get too much blood on the other slice of bread.</li>
    <li>Cover the slice of bread with whatever ammount of substance you
      were able to cleave from the body of the Peanut Butter</li>
    <li>Set camp and rest for the night.
      The hardest part is yet to come!</li>
    <li>As dawn breaks, put on your coolest shades and most fashionable
      outfit. The Extremeberry Jam can sense those too old and out
      of touch!</li>
    <li>Once you have calmed your fears and poppped your collar,
      open the Extremeberry Jam Jar.</li>
    <li>Oh no! You weren't cool enough!</li>
    <li>Try to fight the Extremeberry Jam with your
      Bejewled Blade of +2 Spreading</li>
    <li>That won't work, you dummy! You'll have to try something else!</li>
    <li>Try to tell the Extremeberry Jam all the Pokemon you know by name.</li>
    <li>It hates that! The Extremeberry Jam retreats back into its jar!</li>
    <li>Act quickly and scoop some out with your Bejewled Blade of +2
      Spreading</li>
    <li>Smoosh a bunch on the other (hopefully) not bloody slice of bread.</li>
    <li>Close your eyes.</li>
    <li>Make sure they're closed</li>
    <li>Peel the Banana from the treasury of her majesty, Queen Kong</li>
    <li>Be careful not to peek, they're very bashful when naked.</li>
    <li>Slice the naked (now screaming) Banana on Peanut Butter coated
      slice of bread.</li>
    <li>Allow the Peanut Butter to hold the scrambling pieces to the bread
      slice</li>
    <li>Press the two slices together, ingredient laden sides together like
      they're kissing</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> make kissey noises while you do this.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Once connected, hold them in place with a vice.</li>
    <li>Prepare a fire.</li>
    <li>After your fire reaches the right color/smell, loose some Butter
      from the Ubercow into a cast silver skillet</li>
    <li>Do not succumb to the sirens call to touch the melted Butter.</li>
    <li>Release the samm'ich from the vice.</li>
    <li>Wrestle the samm'ich to the pan.</li>
    <li>Wait for the curses to release from the bread before flipping.</li>
    <li>After the samm'ich stops moving, remove from the pan.
      <strong>(This may take up to 7 days.)</strong></li>
    <li>Enjoy Grandma Doug's Good Old Fashioned Homemade Peanut Butter
      & Jelly Samm'ich!</li>
    <li>Repeat process from step one, if you would like a second helping.</li>
    <li>You <em>WILL</em> want a second helping.</li>
